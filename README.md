## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.png)

## My process

I looked at the designs and tried to find containers to fit the content. I identified one big container for the card and two containers for the image and text. The process took me 45min, I estimated it to take 2 hours.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I didn't need to use another div for the image, and just used it as is. Learned some behaviour of margin in regards to max-width.
